        New Delhi: Republic Day marks the adoption of the constitution of India and the transition of the country to a republic on January 26, 1950. Every year, the celebrations marking the day feature spectacular military and cultural pageantry. In New Delhi, armed forces personnel march along the Rajpath, in an elaborate display of military might. The epic show on Rajpath eclipses everything else happening across the country on this auspicious day.
      </b></p>
      <h2 class="w3-wide" class="w3-wide" class="w3-opacity" style="font-style: Alfa Slab One;font-size: 30px;color: #220ef7;"><b> <i>History</i></b></h2>
      <p class="w3-left-align w3-text-black"style="font-style: Alfa Slab One;font-size: 19.4px;"><b>
        While our Independence Day celebrates freedom from British Rule, Republic Day commemorates the constitution coming into force. January 26 was the chosen date since it was on this day in 1929 that the Indian National Congress issued the Declaration of Indian Independence (Purna Swaraj), opposing the British Regime's Dominion status.
      </b></p>
      <p class="w3-left-align w3-text-black"style="font-style: Alfa Slab One;font-size: 19.4px;"><b>
        On August 15, 1947, India achieved independence. A committee was created a few days later, on August 29, to draft a permanent constitution for independent India. Dr BR Ambedkar was made chairman of the committee. On November 4, 1947, the committee drafted the constitution and submitted it to the Constituent Assembly. The Assembly met in numerous sessions for nearly two years before finally adopting the Constitution. On January 24, 1950, the 308 members of the Assembly signed two handwritten versions of the agreement -- one in Hindi and one in English -- after much deliberation and a few changes.The constitution came into effect two days later, on January 26, 1950. Dr Rajendra Prasad began his first tenure as President of the Indian Union on that day.

    <h2 class="w3-wide"class="w3-wide" class="w3-opacity" style="font-style: Alfa Slab One;font-size: 30px;color: #1009e6;"><b><i>Significance </i></b></h2>
      <p class="w3-left-align w3-text-black"style="font-style: Alfa Slab One;font-size: 19.4px;"><b>
        India's constitution, which was formally adopted in 1950, replaced the British colonial Government of India Act (1935) as the country's governing text.
      </b></p>
      <p class="w3-left-align w3-text-black"style="font-style: Alfa Slab One;font-size: 19.4px;"><b>
        On January 26, 1950, the Preamble to the Constitution of India -- a statement presenting the key principles of the Constitution -- came into effect. This completed the country's transition to a sovereign republic. The Constitution establishes fundamental rights that should be enjoyed by all citizens of this country, regardless of their political beliefs. It also establishes some fundamental duties for all citizens of the country to abide by.

      <p class="w3-left-align w3-text-black"style="font-style: Alfa Slab One;font-size: 19.4px;"><b>
        1). Between 1950 and 1954, the Republic Day parade was held at Irwin Stadium (now National Stadium), Kingsway, Red Fort, and Ramlila grounds.</b>
      </p class="w3-left-align w3-text-black"style="font-style: Alfa Slab One;font-size: 19.4px;"><b>
      <p class="w3-left-align w3-text-black"style="font-style: Alfa Slab One;font-size: 19.4px;"><b>
        2). Republic Day celebrations have been held at Rajpath since 1955. Rajpath was once known as the Kingsway, in honour of India's then emperor, George V. The road was renamed Rajpath after independence, which also means King's Way in Hindi.
      </b></p>
      <p class="w3-left-align w3-text-black"style="font-style: Alfa Slab One;font-size: 19.4px;"><b>
        3). Every year, the leader of a particular nation is invited to be the chief guest for the Republic Day parade. President Sukarno of Indonesia was the first to attend India's Republic Day celebrations as chief guest in 1950.
      </b></p>
      <p class="w3-left-align w3-text-black"style="font-style: Alfa Slab One;font-size: 19.4px;"><b>
        4). The parade starts after the arrival of the President of India. The President's cavalier bodyguards salute the National Flag first. The National Anthem is played, followed by a 21-gun salute. The firing is, however, not done using 21 canons. It is done with seven canons of the Indian army known as '25-Ponders' that fire three rounds each.
      </b></p>
      <p class="w3-left-align w3-text-black"style="font-style: Alfa Slab One;font-size: 19.4px;"><b>
        5). Each member of the army who takes part in the march must go through four layers of investigation. Aside from that, their arms are extensively inspected to ensure they are not carrying live bullets.

             The immense sacrifices that Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi made for India earned him the title of “Father of the Nation”; he was born on October 2, 1869. Along with inspiring numerous other independence movements and human rights movements around the world, he not only helped lead India to independence but also played a significant role in its victory. India is recognized for embracing the concept of nonviolence thanks to Gandhi, popularly known as Bapu. He thought that nonviolent resistance and an unwillingness to cooperate with the British would be enough to bring about independence.

        India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a kaleidoscopic variety and rich cultural heritage. It has achieved all-round socio-economic progress during the last 65 years of its Independence. India has become self-sufficient in agricultural production and is now one of the top industrialized countries in the world and one of the few nations to have gone into outer space to conquer nature for the benefit of the people. It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. As you travel, India offers a range of vast tourism choices, diverse in land and nature, people, tribes, cuisine, faiths, dance forms, music, arts, crafts, adventure, sport, spirituality, history; even these vary as you journey from one state to another. As a country, India has achieved all-round socio-economic progress in the last 70 years of independence. The change is clearly visible in the Tier I and Tier II cities. However, the fascinating aspect lies in the stark difference as you travel through the new and old parts of its cities. From world-class airports and hotels, luxurious shopping malls, restaurants, pubs and cafes to overcrowded streets and alleyways, in the same cities, filled with thousands of little shops offering every possible modern and ethnic product and native street food is a fascinating experience.

            <p><b>About Indian National Flag</b></p>
            <div class="comment more">
              The Indian National Flag symbolises national pride and is one of the most respected national symbols. The late Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru called it "a flag not only of freedom for ourselves but a symbol of freedom to all the people."
              As per the Indian laws, the national flag is to be made up of khadi. The flag code of India governs the usage of the flag. Initially, use of the Indian flag by private citizens was prohibited, except on national days like Republic Day and Independence Day. But gradually, some changes were made by the Union Cabinet about the flag's use by private citizens. The code was amended about its usage for hoisting and its adaptation on other types of clothes.
              Significance of Indian National Flag colours:- Saffron: Saffron is a symbol of courage and sacrifice. White: The white colour represents honesty, peace, and purity. It highlights the importance of maintaining peace in the country. Green: The green colour represents faith and chivalry. It is a symbol of prosperity, vibrancy, and life. Ashoka Chakra: The Ashoka Chakra or the Dharma Chakra (Wheel of Law) has 24 spokes and appears on a number of edicts of Ashoka.
              History of Indian National Flag:- The Indian National Flag represents India's long struggle for freedom. It signifies the status of India as an independent republic. The flag came into being in its present form at the meeting of Constitutional Assembly on 22 July 1947. Since then it has served as the National Flag of the Dominion of India from 15 August 1947 to 26 January 1950 and, thereafter, as the national flag of the Republic of India. The Indian National Flag was designed by Pingali Venkayya and contains three equal strips of saffron, white and green.

            <p><b>Independent India</b></p>
            <div class="comment more">
               India's moment of glory finally arrived on the midnight of 15 August 1947. People, delirious with joy, flooded the streets to welcome the dawn of a new era. And within the Assembly Hall, Jawaharlal Nehru rose to make his famous "tryst with destiny" speech. By the early hours of morning, as the clouds sent a light drizzle to acknowledge the awakening, independent India was all set to transform from a colonial society into a liberal polity.

                Jawaharlal Nehru became independent India's first Prime Minister and Rajendra Prasad the country's first President.

                The Indian Constitution was drawn up in a matter of four years. It sought to assimilate different linguistic regions and religious communities of India into a cohesive Nation-State while, at the same time, conferring substantial autonomy upon the diverse states of the Indian Union.The founding fathers, under the leadership of B R Ambedkar, based governance of the country upon the free choice of its citizens. The Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary started functioning long before such systems were recognised by international thinkers.

               India embarked upon planning and began to address the issues like land reforms, improvement of agricultural marketing techniques and irrigation facilities. Reducing dependency on the fickle monsoons was a major priority area since most of Indian agriculture is rain-fed.

               All this required, in addition to planning, a good deal of research. Moving over to scientific research and development, India raised her agricultural production to a consistent growth rate of three percent per annum.

            <p><b>History Of India</b></p>
            <div class="comment more">
              India's earliest known civilization arose about 5,000 years ago on the Indus River in what is now Pakistan. Archaeologists uncovered the remains of two huge cities with brick houses, piped water, and sewer systems. Nobody knows why, but these cities, called Harappa and Mohenjo Daro, were abandoned in 1700 B.C.
              The Aryan people were farmers from Central Asia who arrived in India around 1500 B.C. They spoke Sanskrit, one of the world's oldest known languages. The Vedic Scriptures, writings that form the basis of the Hindu religion, were written during the Aryan reign.
              In the 200-year reign of the Gupta Empire, starting in the fourth century A.D., arts, crafts, and sciences flourished. During this time, the Indian astronomer Aryabhatta determined that the Earth revolved around the sun. This was long before the Western world accepted the theory.
              Beginning in the 16th century, following a series of invasions by Muslim forces, a Mongol leader named Babur founded the Mongol Empire. The Mongols oversaw a golden age of art, literature, and architecture in India between 1527 and 1707. They built roads, mosques, gardens, and enormous tombs, including the grand Taj Mahal 
              In the late 1400s, Europeans arrived in India and began setting up trading companies. In 1757, Britain gained control over most of the country. Uprisings against British rule began in 1856. In 1920, the famous Mahatma Gandhi began nonviolent protests to push the British out. In 1947, India had independence.

            <div class="comment more">
              PEOPLE & CULTURE :- 
              Society throughout India is divided into social ranks, called castes. Caste is determined by birth and there is almost no way to change it. High castes include priests, landowners, and soldiers. So-called Untouchables have no caste and do the most menial jobs.
              India is a very spiritual country. It has no official religion, but more than 80 percent of Indians are Hindu. About 13 percent are Muslim. Other religions include Buddhism, Sikhism, and Jainism, which all began in India.
              NATURE :- 
              For thousands of years, since the Hindu religion first evolved, respect for animal life has been an important part of Indians' beliefs. Cows in particular are sacred and cannot be harmed. They are even allowed to wander through city streets, which often causes traffic jams!
              India's varied climate zones support about 65,000 animal species, including elephants, pythons, river dolphins, and rhinos, and 12,000 types of flowering plants. It is the only country in the world with both lions and tigers. It's also a bird watcher's paradise.
              On the coast of the Bay of Bengal is the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest. Here, tigers swim in the same rivers as dolphins, sea turtles, sharks, and saltwater crocodiles. This unique landscape is constantly under threat as sea levels rise and humans hunt illegally and clear trees for firewood.
              The Himalaya mountains provide a home for some of India's rarest animals and plants. The most elusive animal is the snow leopard. Bears and black buck live lower down, and in the northeast, the tiger and one-horned rhinoceros can be found.

While 94% of the world's Hindus live in India, there also are substantial populations of Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains and adherents of folk religions.
                According to some estimates, there are roughly 4,200 religions, churches, denominations, religious bodies, faith groups, tribes, cultures, movements, ultimate concerns, which at some point in the future will be countless.

               India's parliamentary government was inherited from the British. After independence in 1947, one party, the Congress Party, and one family, the Nehru family, dominated politics in India for decades. Now, however, many parties compete for elected positions. 
               India's economy is growing so fast that experts predict it will soon become one of the world's leading markets. Indians are hard workers. And though many are poorly educated, there are many others who are highly trained college graduates.
